### 📑Job Market Paper
*"Practice-style spillovers in hospital care: evidence from lower extremity joint replacement surgery"*
Medicare policy are designed to target the Medicare patients only. Do it also affect the other patients with other insurance plans? The answer is yes. In this paper I show a bundled payment model will induce the healthcare providers to treat non-Medicare patients the same type they treat Medicare patients. Surprisingly, the scale of the spillover effects are larger than the direct effects. I also investigate the mechanism by showing that healthcare providers more exposing to the model will be more affected. 
Using: `R`, `STATA`, `Python` <br />
